        <h2> March 7 2024</h2>
        <p> i am very grateful to every single one of my friends. it's been an honor to be in a journey with people who have tried their best to let me know how much they love and appreciate me. i will always reciprocate that. they've always let me know that i am not a stranger in any way, shape or form and that i am totally fine the way i am. needless to say, i am gay. there are people who i wish would change their opinions for the sake of my happiness but i know that's not an obligation nor is it a compulsion for them to be my friends. i can just hide it and close curtains on some of the pretty irrelevant aspects of my life. i feel very loved. i don't feel depressed anymore. i do not feel happy either. i do not feel frustrated either. i feel anxious and have zero passion for stuff that i need to be yearning for. i am alone and disintegrating as i am dwelling in monotone. it's just so weird seeing people around me dying to be in a relationship, being so dissatisfied with life and obsessed with people who they love. i am obsessed too, don't get me wrong. but it's such a light platonic obsession that doesn't really crave for attention nor is it desperate for constant reassurance and love. i am just so confused. </p>

        <p>on paper, i should be miserable. but i am not. i know i am far from being content as well. so what the fuck is wrong with me? i have nothing going on in my life. there's nothing to look forward to. there is nothing to be happy for. there is nothing to live for. but i do not feel anything as intensely as i used to. why does it take forever for me to articulate my emotions? am i numb? have i not come out of depression?</p>

        <h2> March 31 2024 </h2>
        <p> <strong> never fucking mind.</strong> it might feel like people are resenting you or that people hate being your friend. and i know it's killing you from the inside. but this time, your hurt is way different than what it was before. i know you have no idea who you are or what you're worth. but you know that <em>intellectually</em> basing your worth by someone else's perception is logically flawed. people might not get you, people might think you're pretentious, weird and annoying. honestly, just don't care dawg. because let me tell you what, your intent is pure. you may fuck up at times but all of this is coming from a place of insecurity and lack of affection. just keep moving forward. this time be upset that you've lost friends because they failed to understand you. do not be upset that you've lost friends because something's wrong with you. you don't have to rush your healing and insecurities just so that you can appeal to people you love. take it slow, you have all the time in your hands. i am very proud of how far you've come. if you ever go to a dark place just remember to not sit in darkness. lift your ass up and turn on the lights.

        <h2> Points to talk about in therapy</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> i don't think my problems are that cynical or depressing for now, but i am afraid i might go back to my vigilant state. </li>
            <li> i've been hurt in the past. i loved a lot of people and i've gotten dependent on them as time went by. but then, when i realised that i meant nothing to the people i've loved so hard, it felt demoralizing and pointless. i thought my friendships and love were a moral support and an active way to push me to become better. but now, friendship to me feels like a lot of work. there's a lot of unpredictability involved and a lot of explosive episodes involved that i simply cannot put aside in an instant. </li>
            <li> i start overthinking the most basic conversations and situations and create a mental simulation that reaffirms my abandonment issues. and then i obsess over the thought of everything coming to an end and how it feels to just let go of it all. </li>
            <li> i do think i can let go a lot easier than whatever it takes to maintain a relationship. even the slightest inconvenience causes a state of despair in my mind and it feels just right to think about how the longevity is not in my foresight.</li>
            <li> i know my current friendships and my other good friends who i've fostered for a long time are nothing like the asshole that i've met in the previously. but it's just that i get alerted so quickly when something remotely similar happens to what has happened to me before. </li>
            <li> i've not been eating very well. i do have body dysmorphia. it's fair to say that i do not have a very thick skin when it comes to jokes about my insecurities. even the smallest comment about how i am kind of "broad" or how i am kind of "puffier" makes me want to starve just a little bit. it's more about my idea of a perfect body than what others might judge me as. i know not a lot of people care about the way i look, the way i walk and talk. but it just gets frustrating when you've never been allowed to feel satisfied or feel happy for just who you are. there's always a room for improvement inside of me, is what my inner monologue reverbs for the most part. some people have insecurities similar to this, even outside of food. but this is the one area where i feel like i might have to come to terms with because starving is not the optimal thing to do. ofc.</li>
